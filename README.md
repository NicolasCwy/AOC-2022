Advent of Code 2022

Goal: Learn and familiarise myself with C++, therefore all challenges will be done in C++

Note: 
- Add new line at end of input files using vim to ensure that all inputs are read
- Done using C++17, compile using the command g++ -std=c++17 day-4-p1.cpp -o day1


TODO: Day 3 doesn't need newline at end of input. Standardise this among all days.
